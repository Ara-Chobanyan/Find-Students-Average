# Find-Students-Average

A simple program to create a group of students, input their grades, and to find there averages.

# What I learned

- Basic concepts of creating tests for small math functions or conversations.
- Taking in users' inputs via bufio NewScanner function.
- Using maps and how to manipulate them via custom functions.
- How to combine inputs and functions and to manipulate maps (but allowing for users to do it on their end).
- Using structs to create a custom data structure.
- Using pointers to create the student data structure to avoid duplication (still not too sure on that, need to experiment more).

# What I struggled with

- Creating tests for taking in user inputs (further research is needed on those types of test).
- Making a test to compare two slice variables (resolved after comparing the indexes).
- Creating exportable functions with custom return type (I had to keep experimenting with their return values).

# Credit

- Helped me for converting user inputs into slices https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43599253/read-space-separated-integers-from-stdin-into-int-slice

# Future Goal

I plan to add on top of this project by adding a data base to it and even a terminal tui to make it look nice.
