# find-students-average

A simple program to create a group of students, and inputting there grades to find there average.

# What I learned

- Learned basic concepts of creating test for small math functions or conversations.
- Gotten much more comfortable with taking in users inputs via bufio NewScanner function.
- Learned more about using maps and how to add to them or to delete keys within them
- As well learned on how to combine inputs and functions, to manipulate maps but for allowing users to do it on there end.
- Messed around with struts to create a custom data structure, to be used to create a student data structure to be used in the program.
- Played around with pointers in creating the student data structure to avoid duplication. (Still not too sure on that need to play around more)

# What I struggled with

- Struggled in creating tests for taking in user inputs, really need to work on those types of test and to do more research on them.
- Struggled for a bit in making a test to compare two slice variables, then I realized oh wait I need to check the indexes.
- Had trouble in creating exportable functions with a custom return type, so I had to keep experimenting with there return values.

# Credit

- Helped me for converting user inputs into slices https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43599253/read-space-separated-integers-from-stdin-into-int-slice
